# StockTradingRL
This project leverages reinforcement learning to develop an AI agent for stock trading using historical price data.
A reinforcement learning project that uses historical stock data to train an AI agent to make trading decisions. This project features a custom environment, StocksEnvWithCapital, where the agent learns actions like buying, selling, or holding based on past price movements (configured with bars_count to define the history window). It includes functions for training, validation, and performance tracking to optimize the agentâ€™s trading strategy over time.
